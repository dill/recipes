1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas mark 6.
2. Line an 8 inch square baking tin with greaseproof paper and lightly oil or butter the paper - an oil spray is ideal for this.
3. Cut the butter into cubes. Put the chocolate and butter into a dish and stand over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until the butter and chocolate have melted into a smooth, glossy sauce. Chop in banana and mash into the mix.
4. While the chocolate is melting, whisk the sugar and eggs with an electric whisk for 4-5 minutes until they have thickened; add salt and fold through.
5. Sift in the flour and fold through.
6. Finally, fold through the melted chocolate/butter mixture.
7. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 22-25 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before lifting the brownie out of the pan. Allow to cool completely (in fridge to aid structural integrity?).
9. Once cold, cut into 16 squares and store in an airtight container.
