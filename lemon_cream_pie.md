## For the "Graham cracker" base:

(Recipe from [here](http://www.glutenfreebaking.com/gluten-free-graham-crackers/).

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In the bowl of a food processor, combine dry ingredients. Pulse to combine. (If you don't have a food processor, whisk dry ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl.)
2. Add the butter. Pulse until flour mixture is coarse. No large pieces of butter should remain. (Or cut cold butter into flour mixture with a pastry cutter, two knives or by rubbing the butter between your fingers.)
3. Add milk and honey. Pulse until dough forms. (Or stir using a wooden spoon.)
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly rice floured piece of 12x16 parchment paper.
5. Pat dough into a rectangle. Dust the top of the dough lightly with rice flour.
6. Place another piece of 12-by-16-inch parchment paper on top of the dough. Roll dough out until it covers all of the paper. Dough rectangle will be about 1/8 inch thick.
7. Carefully remove top piece of parchment paper.
8. Transfer dough, with bottom parchment paper, to a 12 x 18 baking pan.
9. Prick dough all over with a fork.
10. Chill dough for 10 minutes.
11. Bake for 15 minutes or until evenly brown.
12. Remove graham crackers from the pan and place on a wire rack to cool.
Allow crackers to cool completely. Break along scored lines.

## Filling

Having made the Graham crackers:

1. Preheat the oven to 325F, making sure one of the racks is in the middle of the oven. Break the graham crackers into pieces and add them to a blender, food processor or ziploc bag and crush (or roll the bag with a rolling pin) until the crackers are finely ground. Mix in the sugar and butter (if using a ziploc bag, transfer the cracker crumbs to a bowl before adding ingredients).
2. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake the crust for 12-14 minutes, until it is just beginning to brown. Cool the crust completely on wire rack.
3. Once the crust is cool, preheat the oven to 375F.
4. Measure out 3 tablespoons of the sweetened condensed milk and set aside in a small container (it will be used later). Whisk the remaining condensed milk with the egg yolks until smooth. Slowly whisk in the lemon juice. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake the pie until the edges are just set but the center still jiggles when the pie plate is lightly moved, about 15 minutes.
5. Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack and then cover and refrigerate until well-chilled and set, about 3 hours or up to 24 hours.
6. When ready to serve, using an electric stand mixer or handheld mixer, whip the cream, reserved condensed milk and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Spread the whipped topping over the pie. At this point, the pie could be chilled for up to an hour (any longer and the whipped cream topping can cause the pie to 'weep' and get liquidy).
