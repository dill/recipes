1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Stir until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little.
2. Add turmeric, red-pepper flakes and chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper. Stir frequently, chickpeas sizzle until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp.
3. Remove about a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.
4. Crush the remaining chickpeas slightly w/ masher. Add coconut milk and stock. Simmer, scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot.
5. Add greens and stir, making sure they’re submerged in the liquid. Cook til they wilt.
