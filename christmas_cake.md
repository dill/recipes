1. Soak fruit in sherry for 3 days
2. Mix flours and spice and almonds and rind, then marg.and sugar. Add eggs a bit at a time. Add treacle and sherry, then finally fruit.
3. Grease and line cake tin. Then fasten brown paper round the outside so it comes up a bit higher than the tin to stop it burning.
4. The recipe says 2 hrs at gas2 (150) then 1.25 hrs at gas 1 (100) but keep an eye open. I often turn down a bit earlier. Test the centre with a skewer.
